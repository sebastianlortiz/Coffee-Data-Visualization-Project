My great-grandparents used to be owners of coffee farms in Colombia. Going back to the late 1800s and early 1900s, we have always been a coffee drinking and coffee producing nation. My father and I have always considered opening a coffeeshop to continue watering our roots as coffeemakers. In consideration of this, I have always been curious - what is the best coffee in the world? If we were to have a coffeeshop, what coffees would we want? We would probably want an assortment of coffees - not just being limited to Colombian (however biased we may be). We would want to have a truly diverse array of coffees. Coffee from all around the world. What is the best coffee from each continent? Which country produces the best coffee? What processing method produces the best tasting coffee? These are the questions I set out to answer in this project.'}, {'cell_type': 'markdown', 'id': 'a9c2a7c3', 'metadata': {}, 'source': "Coffee is the lifeblood of people all around the world. From the working class to upper class, this beautiful bean powers our days. Indeed, coffee may be the reason the world goes 'round. In our days as coffee drinkers, we may have had our fair share of delicious and disgusting coffees. Life is short - we should try to focus on those coffees which are best. Let us find out - which country, according to an average of experts, produces the best coffee?
